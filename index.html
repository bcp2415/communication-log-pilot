    <p>Radio check. Pilot, please confirm.</p>
    <p>Confirming. Message received.</p>
    <p>Ok, pilot. Are you on the ground or did you take off?</p>
    <p>
      Control, we took off ten minutes ago because we were tired of waiting for
      you to show up. What took so long?

      Pilot, I think you forgot that we started Daylight Savings Time this
      morning. You took off an hour early.

      Are you sure? I thought that was next weekend. Also, our watches have all
      stopped here, so we're just telling time by the sun's position.
